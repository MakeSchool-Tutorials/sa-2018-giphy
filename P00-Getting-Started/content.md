In this tutorial we will cover:

- What an API is and how to use one
- Introduction to JSON
- Introduction to Postman
- Building a web application using Node.js and Bootstrap

# If you get stuck

"Sometimes, magic is just someone spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect." - Teller (Penn & Teller)

Getting stuck when coding (and debugging) is a natural part of the programming process. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or lost, pause for a moment and take a breath. Maybe take a walk. Then retrace your steps (in the tutorial, not the walk.) Make sure you've follow each step of the tutorial. It's easy to make typos or to accidentally skip over important steps.
