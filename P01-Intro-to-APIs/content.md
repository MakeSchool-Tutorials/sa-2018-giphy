# What is an API?

The first section of the tutorial should summarize what the student will learn and what tools they'll use. It should also outline any prerequisites for understanding the material and link to resources for getting up to speed. It's usually a good idea to show a screenshot or video of the final product and link to the solution repository.

Do not create a feedback section linking to the tutorial content repo. This is now done automatically!
